# Automated Testing

I attempted to do my best to separate Unit and Integration tests from each other. There's a bit of overlap in some areas as the library stands at this point in time. Further refactoring is required at this point to do a 100% pure separation.

## Unit Tests

All Unit Test templates contain metadata.name to appease the helm linter.

## Running Unit Tests

```shell

```

## Running Integration Tests

```shell

```

## Random Notes
